# family-trivia-react
family feud clone in react with github pages, and firebase.

## Introduction

I have been contemplating doing this game for a while, I was going to go the easy route and build it on unity3D, but since I really like the challenge I will build it in react after taking a course on it. I am a well seasoned programmer in python and java so if I make a crazy mistake know that web is not my forte.

## Why

At the house we play games on Sunday, and Family Feud is a nice game for the family. The problem with many implementations is the lack of surveys, or some you have to actually create them to start playing. The one I downloaded was a powerpoint, and I had to go into each slide and put my survey questions and answers and some fake survey points.

## Goal

The goal is to have a self sustaining system where players can build the survey ecosystem, so others can quickly play. It will take some time to build the survey database, but in the end I think it will be a pretty good system overall.

## How to Contribute

I thought it would be a good idea to host this for hacktoberfest. All contributions are welcomed!
I do have a full time job, so if you are interested in collaborating and have react experience/firebase let me know. 

If you have a better idea for the design all ideas are welcome, I just want to have the game fully available online without having to pay for hosting, for the most part firebase free account is pretty good and I don't think surveys will use too much bandwidth.
